## Features

- Insert test values into specific fields.
- Count the total number of conducted tests.
- Delete test values from fields.
- Display the top two test values with maximum occurrences.
- Calculate the average test score of all fields.
- Display fields with the maximum success scores.
- Display all test values in all fields.

## Getting Started

To run the **Pestcouts** an emerging Pesticide Research Lab Test Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
